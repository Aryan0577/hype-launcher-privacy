  <h1>Phi Launcher – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 21, 2025</p>
  <p>
    Phi Launcher (“the App”) is developed and maintained by Aryan Srivastava & Aryan Poonia (“we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. Your privacy is our top priority.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum amount of data necessary. We do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information (PII) that you don't provide, such as your name, email, or phone contacts.</p>
  
  <h3>a) Information You Provide Voluntarily:</h3>
  <p>For features like the "Dev Panel," you may provide your usernames for third-party services (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces). This information is sent directly to those services' public APIs to fetch your profile data and is stored locally on your device.</p>
  
  <h3>b) Anonymous Usage & Crash Data (Analytics):</h3>
  <p>
    If you provide consent during the app's setup, we use Google's Firebase services to collect anonymous, aggregated data to help us improve the app and fix bugs. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> If the app crashes, this service sends us an anonymous report with technical information (e.g., device type, OS version, and the location of the crash in the code) so we can find and fix the bug.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      This data collection is **optional**. You can opt-out at any time from the app's permission screen or settings. For more information, you can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>
  

  <h2>2. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Phi Launcher offers optional premium features through a one-time purchase, managed by the Google Play Billing service. We use the `com.android.vending.BILLING` permission to facilitate these transactions. We do not collect or store your payment information (like credit card numbers). All payment processing is handled securely by Google. You can review <a href="https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/u/0/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=privacynotice" target="_blank">Google Payments' Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

  <h2>3. Permissions Requested</h2>
  <p>The App requests the following Android permissions solely to provide its features. All data processed for these features remains on your device unless specified below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to fetch data for online features (like the Dev Panel), process payments, and send anonymous analytics/crash reports if you have provided consent.</li>
    <li><strong>com.android.vending.BILLING:</strong> To handle in-app purchases for premium features through Google Play.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used by libraries like Firebase and Google Play to check for an internet connection before sending data.</li>
    <li><strong>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID / android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID / android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION / com.google.android.finsky.permission.BIND_GET_INSTALL_REFERRER_SERVICE:</strong> Used for anonymous analytics, advertising, and install attribution.</li>
    <li><strong>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS:</strong> To display your app usage statistics on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To send you local notifications (e.g., for to-do reminders).</li>
    <li><strong>BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE:</strong> To read active notifications, enabling features like hiding notifications from selected apps or for the music widget.</li>
    <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:</strong> To ensure the launcher starts correctly after your device reboots.</li>
    <li><strong>REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES:</strong> To allow you to uninstall apps directly from the launcher.</li>
    <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE:</strong> Required by modern Android for reliable background tasks, such as updating app usage stats.</li>
    <li><strong>USE_BIOMETRIC / USE_FINGERPRINT:</strong> To secure your hidden apps with your device's biometrics.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> To provide haptic feedback for interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>EXPAND_STATUS_BAR:</strong> To allow the launcher to show or hide the status bar (e.g., in full-screen mode or via gestures).</li>
    <li><strong>WAKE_LOCK:</strong> To prevent the device from sleeping during critical operations, ensuring tasks complete reliably.</li>
    <li><strong>com.launcher.hype.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION:</strong> A custom permission for internal app processes, ensuring components can communicate securely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics):</strong> For anonymous usage and crash reporting, if you provide consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing & Licensing Services:</strong> To process in-app purchases and verify app licenses.</li>
      <li><strong>Public APIs of LeetCode and Codeforces:</strong> To provide data for the Dev Panel feature, called only when you use it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All your personal settings, to-do lists, and app data are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this data to our servers. You are responsible for securing your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed toward children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
