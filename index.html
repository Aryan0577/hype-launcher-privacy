  <h1>Hype Launcher – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>
  <p>
    Hype Launcher (“the App”) is developed and maintained by Aryan Srivastava & Aryan Poonia (“we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the App. Your privacy is our top priority.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our guiding principle is to be a launcher that respects your privacy. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from your device.</p>
  
  <h3>a) Information You Provide Voluntarily:</h3>
  <p>For features like the "Dev Panel," you may voluntarily provide your usernames for third-party services (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces). This information is sent directly to those services' public APIs to fetch your profile data and is stored locally and encrypted on your device. We do not have access to it.</p>
  
  <h3>b) Data Processed on Your Device:</h3>
  <p>All other data, such as your list of installed apps, app usage statistics, and to-do list items, remains exclusively on your device. This data is never sent to us or any third party.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Requested</h2>
  <p>The App requests the following Android permissions solely to provide its features. All data processed for these features remains on your device.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> To fetch data from online services like Codeforces/LeetCode for the Dev Panel.</li>
    <li><strong>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS:</strong> To display your app usage statistics on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To send you local notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE:</strong> To enable features like hiding notifications from your selected hidden apps.</li>
    <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:</strong> To ensure the launcher starts correctly and reliably after your device reboots.</li>
    <li><strong>REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES:</strong> To allow you to uninstall apps directly from the launcher.</li>
    <li><strong>FOREGROUND_SERVICE:</strong> Required by modern Android for reliable background tasks, such as updating app usage stats.</li>
    <li><strong>EXPAND_STATUS_BAR:</strong> To provide quick access gestures that interact with the status bar.</li>
    <li><strong>USE_BIOMETRIC / USE_FINGERPRINT:</strong> To secure your hidden apps with your device's biometrics.</li>
    <li><strong>VIBRATE:</strong> To provide haptic feedback for interactions like gestures and taps.</li>
    <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used by libraries to check for an internet connection before attempting to fetch data for features like the Dev Panel.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> use advertising SDKs, analytics trackers, or crash reporting tools.</p>
  <p>The only third-party services used are the public APIs of LeetCode and Codeforces, which are called only when you explicitly use the Dev Panel feature.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All your personal settings, to-do lists, and app data are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this data to our servers. You are responsible for securing your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed toward children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p>
